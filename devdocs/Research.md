### How would the system evaluate winners & losers?

Users are challenging each other about real world events, hence for the system to be able to evaluate the outcome of these challenges it must have access to real world happenings.

These are smart contract systems and hence do not have access to real world events by default. In order to evaluate the outcome of challenges, oracles are needed to determine tell the smart contracts about real world events. A reliable choice to go with is chainlink oracles.

### How would the system automate closing challenge pools?

Since there might be a pool closing event every block, it is necessary to automatically trigger and endpoint on the smart contract to check and close ripe pools. This is also essential to the whole system since pools are time bound and it will be fair to participants to respect that. A reliable choice to go with is chain link automation.
